In development circles, everyone talks about minimalism, or at least the idea that simplicityis a good thing, but I rarely ever find, in an honest, genuine sincerity, true attempts to understand or adhere to minimalist or simple programming and computing experiences.

- many projects try to tackle simplicity, but ignore minimalism, and they are different concepts.

- perhaps simplicity is subjective, and creating simplicity in one area complicates another.

- rich hickey
