Astryx is a programming language for generating static web content and web frontend applications. What's that you say? Another static generator? *But this time it's totally different!* No, really.

Why?

Architecturally and practically, Astryx is quite different from other web generators. It is closer to a flutter or elm than other static tools, but much easier to use and rapidly produce content.

- single binary (makes CI/CD into github/gitlab pages very simple)
- declarative, safe, correct language
- zero boilerplate
- (optionally) a single astryx program generates an entire site of static content and files including html, css, images to a degree, and scripts.
- not specific to blogs, expressive enough for any applicable use case including SPAs

__NOTE: pre-production state, not even alpha yet. pushing updates regularly, check the kanban board for progress__
