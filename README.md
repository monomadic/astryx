Astryx is a programming language for generating static web content and web frontend applications. What's that you say? Another static generator? *But this time it's totally different!* No, really.

Why?

- declarative, safe, correct language
  - aspiring to be something like elm, but far easier and faster to get something going.
- zero boilerplate
- (optionally) single file program generates an entire site
- not specific to blogs, expressive enough for any applicable use case including SPAs

__NOTE: pre-production state, not even alpha yet. pushing updates regularly, check the kanban board for progress__
