_Note: Astryx is still in a very alpha state._

Astryx üßöüèº‚Äç is a declarative, safe, expressive language and compiler for generating static sites and single page web applications. It draws heavy inspiration from the projects svelte, deno, and flutter, but aims to be leaner, much faster, and far simpler to use and master.

- It is similar to **svelte** in that it acts as a complete compiler, not a framework or library. Output is as lean as possible.

- It is similar to **deno** in that it deploys as a single, portable rust binary, with minimal allocations during compilation and is extremely fast. If you're coming from node or a javascript compiler, the difference is brain-rocking.

- It is similar to **flutter** through use of simple declarative code and the redux data flow architecture (soon).

- It is similar to **rust** in its use of highly correct type safety, attempting to capture as many errors as possible during compile time, so they don't make it to runtime.

It is totally unlike and far more powerful than simple templating languages and static content generators, which tend to focus on themes, blogs, etc. Astryx could build a simple blog program like hugo in a few lines of code, or an image gallery constructor, a cryptocurrency tracker, etc.

## What's The Syntax Like?

So far, the syntax looks like a programmatic version of HAML, but this is heavily subject to change before v1 launches.

This astryx program creates an entire blog.

``` haml
%html
  %head
    %link { rel: "stylesheet", href: ./style.css }
  %body
    %h1 My Blog
    for post in ./posts/*.md
      let meta = post.frontmatter()
      %ul
        %li
          %a { href: meta.route }
            meta.title
      @route path=meta.route
        %html
          %head
            %link { rel: "stylesheet", href: ./style.css }
          %body
            %a { href: "/" } My Blog
            %h1
              meta.title
            post.markdown()
```

## CLI Installation

### Cargo

``` bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/monomadic/astryx/

# or, locally:
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/monomadic/astryx/
cargo install --path cli
```

## Usage

Initialising a project in the current directory:
``` bash
astryx init
```

Starting a webserver (the default file is `site.astryx`):
``` bash
astryx serve site.astryx
```

Building all files (the default output directory is `./build`):
``` bash
astryx build
```

## Running the Examples

``` bash
astryx build --input examples/basic.astryx --stdout
```

## Forking

I've worked hard to make the codebase readable, modular and hackable. I believe it serves as a great starting point for forking if you want to make a parser-combinator, interpreter and compiler of your own in rust. I will continue to push for modularity and simplicity and make the code more readable as time goes on.

Having said that I'm just one person at the moment, so any PRs for code quality are more than appreciated.
